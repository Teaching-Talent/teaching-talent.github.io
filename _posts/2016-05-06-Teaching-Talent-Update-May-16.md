### Specialist Leaders of Education (SLEs) - NCTL Accredited Core Training

**Free of charge training, delivered by practicing SLEs**, is designed to equip newly designated Specialist Leaders of Education (SLEs) - or those SLEs who have not previously been provided with the accredited training by the NCTL - with the skills they need to complete their role. SLEs are required to attend one core training day, either on 17th June (Dr Challoner’s Grammar School) or 29th June (St Clement Danes School).

**SLEs who do not attend this training will not be formally accredited.** To book a place, please complete this [online form](http://goo.gl/forms/zWIzOsVz3I) by Wednesday 1st June at the latest. Please note that, after the summer term 2016, all SLE accredited training will be chargeable to schools.

### Improving Teacher Programme (September 2016)

* Aimed at teachers who are not yet securely good and will be designed and built around areas for development identified by Ofsted (eg. behaviour for learning)

* Key objectives are to support teachers to become reflective practitioners so that they continue to develop their practice and to develop mentors within the schools to provide ongoing encouragement and guidance to attendees during and beyond the programme

BCC funding enables us to offer non-selective schools subsidised places (**£100**); the course will be open to other secondary colleagues at **£300** per delegate. This includes the cost of one copy of the WIGT toolkit per school.  For more information, see [this link](http://www.astra-alliance.com/225/latest-news/article/42/astra-improving-teaching-programme-2016).

### Outstanding Teacher Programme (from September 2016)

The [Astra Outstanding Teaching Programme (OTP)](http://www.astra-alliance.com/308/outstanding-teacher-programme-otp-secondary) is now in its third year and has been developed to enable teachers in the alliance who are currently identified as good to work together, with the support of outstanding practitioners in their own school, to develop and refine their practice, undertake professional enquiry and embed new skills and knowledge into their teaching so it is consistently outstanding.  The programme will launch in September 2016 and will be facilitated by outstanding practitioners in the Alliance. For more information, please contact [Amanda Mauro](mailto:amanda@astra-alliance.com).
