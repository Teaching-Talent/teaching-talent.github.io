## Astra; Cygnus and MMLA Teaching Schools - Joint Projects

**Teaching Talent Summer Conference**

We are thrilled to announce our inaugural [Teaching Talent; Leading Talent conference](https://drive.google.com/a/challoners.org/file/d/0B8BuYUG--HR0TDVPZll4eV9nZXRXU3QtMWtJYlNuRTluSm4w/view) will take place on 6th June 2016 and will feature both leadership and subject based workshops.  We have over 40 delegates signed up already ... but we have space for more!  This event is heavily subsidised and will provide powerful professional development and networking opportunities for leaders at all levels.

Keynotes will be provided by *Keven Bartle* and *Phil Beadle*, and there will also be leadership and subject specific workshops.  For more info, please see: [http://goo.gl/Qj0ecS](http://goo.gl/Qj0ecS). To book, please contact [Amanda Mauro](mailto:amanda@astra-alliance.com) or complete [this form](http://goo.gl/forms/w4c9BOL2eg).

**Specialist Leaders of Education (SLEs) - NCTL Accredited Core Training**

We are delighted to announce that Astra, Cygnus and Herts & Bucks TSAs have been successful in securing both funding and accreditation from the NCTL and Teaching Schools Council to deliver the [SLE core training in the South East region](http://www.astra-alliance.com/225/latest-news/article/76/specialist-leaders-of-education-sle-core-training).

*Free of charge training, delivered by practicing SLEs*, is designed to equip newly designated Specialist Leaders of Education (SLEs) - or those SLEs who have not previously been provided with the accredited training by the NCTL - with the skills they need to complete their role. SLEs are required to attend one core training day, either on 17th June (Dr Challonerâ€™s Grammar School) or 29th June (St Clement Danes School).

*SLEs who do not attend this training will not be formally accredited* 

To book a place, please complete this [online form](http://goo.gl/forms/zWIzOsVz3I) by Wednesday 1st June at the latest. Please note that, after the summer term 2016, all SLE accredited training will be chargeable to schools.
