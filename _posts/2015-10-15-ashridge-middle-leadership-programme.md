The Astra Alliance and Ashridge Business School have been running the programme in collaboration for over five years.  The number of schools involved and participants has grown year on year. Many participants have achieved promotion soon after completing the programme, in one case moving from Head of Year to the Headship of a small infant school.  For 2015/16, the course commences on 19th November 2015 at Ashridge Business School.

The stated aims of the programme are:

* __School Leadership__ –to build participants’ ability to handle day to day leadership tasks, whether as subject leaders, leading school projects, handling difficult parents etc;
* __Personal Leadership__ – to develop their personal leadership skills including personal impact, presentation skills, team development, time management, getting the best out of people;
* __Organisational Development__ – to build the schools’ leadership capacity, with leaders at every level.
* Included in the course is a personalised Strength Deployment Inventory (SDI) and Standard Edition test.

### Programme Structure

The content is delivered in two full days at Ashridge – one at the beginning of the programme and one at the end – and six after-school sessions hosted by the schools involved, across a period of approximately ten months.  Participants are required to complete a personal learning project during the second half of the programme showing how they have applied their learning and report on this during the final day.

In all the sessions, every effort is made to target the content and discussions on participants’ experiences as leaders in schools, while also drawing on lessons from other sectors.

An outline of the programme and course dates can be found on the [__Astra Alliance__ website](http://www.astra-alliance.com/314/ashridge-leadership-programme).
