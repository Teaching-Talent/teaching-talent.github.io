__A key issue from current inspections nationally is the need to improve provision for academically more able pupils.__

In secondary schools where improvement has stalled, or where standards have declined, Ofsted inspectors have observed the following common characteristics:

* teaching at Key Stage 3 (11 to 14) fails to build on prior learning
* the most able are not being challenged
* a failure to narrow the gap for disadvantaged pupils

The Ofsted annual report 2014 suggests that:

>“Too many secondary schools are not challenging the most able. In 2013, almost two thirds of the pupils in non-selective schools who attained highly at primary school in English and mathematics did not reach an A or A* in those subjects at GCSE. Nearly a quarter of them did not even achieve a B grade.

>Around a third of our inspections of secondary schools this year identified issues in the teaching of the most able pupils. Inspectors found that teachers’ expectations of the most able were too low. There is a worrying lack of scholarship permeating the culture of too many schools.

>In the year ahead, Ofsted will look even more closely at the performance of the brightest pupils in routine school inspections and will publish a separate report on what findings.”

The current inspection framework states that inspectors must consider:

>“whether leaders and governors have created a culture of high expectations, aspirations and scholastic excellence in which the highest achievement in academic and vocational work is recognised as vitally important.” _Ofsted Handbook 2015_

Schools in our Alliance have developed significant expertise in provision for more able pupils, as recognised by NACE through The Challenge Award. 

This year-long course his will enable schools to review, reflect, and improve their level of challenge for all pupils, and in particular their provision for the academically more able. We hope that following this programme, the group will continue to meet as a network – supporting and sustaining their work in this area and potentially sharing their practice with primary schools in their locality.

###The programme

The programme will consist initially of 6 half-day seminars spread over a year. Each seminar will focus on key aspects of provision for academically more able pupils, drawing on the Challenge Award framework. Following each session, schools will be encouraged to audit this aspect of their provision, identify strengths and areas for development and plan for improvement – reporting back on progress and challenges at the following session. Schools will also be encouraged to engage in small scale action research with a focus on effective practice for academically more able pupils to be presented at a follow up session.

It is anticipated that by the end of the programme, schools would be able to demonstrate quality and consistency of provision for higher-ability learners and increased pace and challenge for all pupils, and be in a strong position to undertake the NACE Challenge Award should they wish to achieve accreditation for their work.
