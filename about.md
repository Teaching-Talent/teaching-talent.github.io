### Teaching Talent

We are network of teaching schools on a collaborative journey to better education.

We are working together to help support and train teachers in schools across the county.

There are currently three secondary Buckinghamshire Teaching School Alliances:

*	[Astra Learning Alliance](http://astra-alliance.com) (led by Dr Challoner’s Grammar School)
*	[Cygnus](http://www.whs.bucks.sch.uk/403/about-whs/cygnus-teaching-school-alliance) (led by Wycombe High School)
*	[The Marlow and Maidenhead Teaching School](http://www.swbgs.com/) (led by Sir William Borlase’s Grammar School)

The three secondary Buckinghamshire Teaching School Alliances have formed a network to offer a cohesive professional development model for all of Buckinghamshire’s secondary school teachers and leaders (current or aspiring). This model has been conceived in the context of an increasingly school­led system at a time ofunprecedented change and challenge; and in the context of an already strongly supported primary school system (Buckinghamshire Learning Trust and other Teaching Schools). Below is a basic map of our reach and associated schools.

Our network offers a model for the professional development of secondary teachers from trainee to headship. This model takes the form of Professional Learning Pathways (PLPs), which (shown below) provide a holistic view of the pedagogical and leadership development needs of a new entrant to the profession, through to senior leadership.

In the design and delivery of these programmes, our vision is to develop and establish Buckinghamshire as an innovative and attractive place for teachers to develop leadership skills while they train and work. We hope this will lead to higher recruitment and retention rates and facilitate the sharing and development of best practice across the County.
